Here I have used crop prediction dataset for Predicting the optimal crop that could be grown in a particular location based on the
soil composition, rainfall, temperature and return of investment is essential for any farmer of the modern world. 
This could not only save farmers from spending extra money on fertilizers but also avoid the dangerous practice of growing the same crops
on the same patch of land repeatedly, which depletes the solid from its natural
resources.

I have used Tensor flow for predicting the model and also trying to implement UI for easy usage!
